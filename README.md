# pdp11-processor
A PDP11-15/20 processor developed in VHDL.

## Inspiration
An organization I'm a part of at RIT, Computer Science House, was given a PDP11-15/20 as their first ever computer way back in the ealry 80's. I thought it would be a cool idea to find documentation on the PDP11 and emulate CSH's first ever computer.

## Educational Purpose
I wanted to give myself a refresher on VHDL since I haven't touched the language in a while. Not only that, but I wanted to give myself more epxereince writing VHDL components with a structural architecture design. I also thought it would be cool to learn about the design of early 16-bit processors.

## Using the Processor
More information will be provided soon on how to set up a Vivado project to generate the code for hardware and test using a testbench.
